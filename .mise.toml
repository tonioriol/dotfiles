# .mise.toml - Default tool versions for mise
# mise is a modern, fast version manager for multiple languages and tools
# See: https://mise.jdx.dev/configuration.html
#
# This file defines default versions for development tools. You can:
# - Override versions per-project by creating a local .mise.toml
# - Install additional tools with: mise use --global <tool>@<version>
# - List available tools with: mise registry
# - See installed tools with: mise list

[tools]
# Node.js LTS (automatically updates to latest LTS release)
# LTS versions receive long-term support and are recommended for most projects
node = "lts"

# Python 3.12 (latest stable release)
# Python 3.12 includes performance improvements and new features
python = "3.12"

# Uncomment and customize as needed for your development workflow:

# === Programming Languages ===
# ruby = "3.3"           # Ruby latest stable
# go = "1.21"            # Go latest stable
# java = "21"            # Java LTS version
# rust = "latest"        # Rust latest stable
deno = "latest"        # Modern JavaScript/TypeScript runtime

# === Infrastructure & Cloud ===
terraform = "latest"   # Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
kubectl = "latest"     # Kubernetes CLI
helm = "latest"        # Kubernetes package manager
awscli = "latest"      # AWS Command Line Interface

# === Build Tools ===
maven = "latest"       # Java build tool
# gradle = "latest"      # Java/Kotlin build tool

# Note: Some tools are better installed via Homebrew:
# - terragrunt, azure-cli, doctl, heroku (not available in mise)
# - k9s, minikube, helmfile (specialized k8s tools)

[env]
# Environment variables (optional)
# Add any default environment variables here that should be set globally
# Example:
# NODE_ENV = "development"
# EDITOR = "code"

# For project-specific environment variables, consider using direnv
# with .envrc files instead of this global configuration

[settings]
# mise settings (optional)
# Uncomment to customize mise behavior
# experimental = true
# verbose = false

# asdf_compat: Enable compatibility with asdf's .tool-versions files
# Set to true if you work on projects that use .tool-versions instead of .mise.toml
# This allows mise to read and respect .tool-versions files automatically
asdf_compat = true
